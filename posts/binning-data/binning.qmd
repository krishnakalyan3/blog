Generating sample data can always help me to understand any underlying concept better. Let's explore the `sample` function. It takes the following parameters (Sample Range, Number of samples, Should the sample be with or without replacement). To know more about this function execute `?sample`

```{r}
set.seed(123)
x <- sample(x = 1:10, replace=TRUE, size  = 10); x
```
The `set.seed` function makes sure that every time random data is generated it is the same. 

### Histogram
A histogram basically groups data into bins. `bins` are also called `buckets`, `intervals`. Histogram represents the distribution of numerical data. The first step is to `bin` the data into a series of non overlapping intervals.

```{r}
hist(x, breaks=3)
```

There are many practical applications of Histograms. Some of them are
