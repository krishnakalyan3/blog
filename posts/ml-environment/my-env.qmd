Creating a good repeatable machine learning environment is often glossed over when working on a new python project. I would like to share how I manage and maintain my `Python` environment.

## Mambaforge
Mambaforge is a minimal installer for conda that also includes mamba and is configured with conda-forge as the default and only channel. Anaconda or Conda is known for being slow when trying to resolve conflicts between dependencies and installing new packages. [Mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) is a replacement for Conda. It's written in C++ for faster execution. Even on a M1 mac it can be a great [choice](https://www.coiled.io/blog/apple-arm64-mambaforge).

Anaconda has also recently changed its [TOS](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/anaconda-commercial-edition-faq) and it's not too clear how this affects us. Sticking to mamba would be a better choice according to me.

## Installation
You can install the latest version of Mambaforge by running the commands below or using this [script](https://github.com/krishnakalyan3/Scripts/blob/master/2022_setup/mambaforge.txt). 

```
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
~/mambaforge/bin/mamba init
```
Exit your current shell session and start another one. Type the command `conda --help` to check that conda environment variables are correctly set.

```
usage: conda [-h] [-V] command ...

conda is a tool for managing and deploying applications, environments and packages.

Options:
â€¦
```

You will observe that `conda config --show channels`  conda-forge is set as the default channel.

```
channels:
  - conda-forge
```

## Creating a New Environment
Simply use the commands below create a new environment called `my_env` with `python 3.9` interpreter.

```
conda create -n my_env python=3.9
conda activate my_env
```
Use `pip install` or `conda install` to install the package of your choice to your environment. 
## Useful Commands
Other than the commands mentioned above you may find these commands below useful.

```
# All conda env created
conda env list
# All packages in current conda env
conda list
# System information
conda info
```
